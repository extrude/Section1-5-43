A <component /> can have props & states when rendering & the component passes props to other
child components. We have access to props & and states when rendering
Props & States simulairties
Props & states are objects: this.props.obj & this.state
Both can be  accessed when rendering: props can pass data to component when rendering &  so can state
Changes to both cause re-renders: For state the component itself can change the data. It does it with this.state call
 -State cannot  cannot change the props data though. If the props data is going to change it is because it is being passed down from the parent. 
Differences
Prop is defined from the parent above. Cant be changed by component.
State is defined by the component itself. Can be changed by component.

Class based Components have an ability stateless functional components do not have and it is why 
stateless functional components are so fast. Class based components have different functions
that fire at different times in the components life cycle. overriding componentDidMount() allows you to have 
access to that function after the components constructor first mounts itself 

Using State corectly
Do not modify state directly
// Wrong
this.state.comment = 'Hello';
// Right
this.setState({comment: 'Hello'});
The only place where you can assign this.state is in the constructor. However you can read
this.state any place else. 
React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance.

Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

For example, this code may fail to update the counter:

// Wrong
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
});

To fix it, use a second form of setState() that accepts a function rather than an object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument:

// Correct
this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
  counter: prevState.counter + props.increment
}));

We used an arrow function above, but it also works with regular functions:

// Correct
this.setState(function(prevState, props) {
  return {
    counter: prevState.counter + props.increment
  };
});
